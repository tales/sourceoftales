--[[

  Script for grouping beings together and letting them patroul

  For creating a patrol choose a name. Then add objects to the map.
  The name of the object has to start with the name followed by a space
  and then the index number of the waypoint. The type of the object has to
  be set to WAYPOINT.

  Possible object parameters:
   + stroll    -> The radius in pixels that will allow the beings to stroll
                  is a being out of this radius it will walk to a random
                  position inside of it
   + tolerance -> The radius in pixels that tells whether a being reached a
                  waypoint. If all beings are within the tolerance radius
                  the next waypoint will be navigated.
